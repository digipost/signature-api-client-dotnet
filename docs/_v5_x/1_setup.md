## Install business certificate

### With dotnet user-secrets (All platforms)

Put the certificate in a safe place on the host machine.

Add the following `UserSecretsId` element to your `.csproj` file

dotnet user-secrets set "Certificate:Path:Absolute" "<your-certificate.p12>"
dotnet user-secrets set "Certificate:Password" "<your-certificate-password>"
```
